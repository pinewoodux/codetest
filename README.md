# Pinewood Front-end Code Test

The purpose of this task is to test your design and front-end coding skills.
You can add to or amend the source files as much as you wish. Feel free to
use any JavaScript libraries or frameworks to complete the task, although bear
in mind that we want to see your abilities and not someone elses.	


Please complete the requirements listed below. Your work must be supported in
all major browsers/platforms using graceful degradation if necessary.


Requirements
======================================================

- Primary Goal: Create a product details page for a Ford Focus. We have supplied the necessary information,
		however; you can add additional information if you feel it helps the page.
		Draw upon convention but try to add your own uniqueness to the page.


- Secondary Goals (nice to have):

	- Design a way of displaying multiple product images within a limited space

	- Improve the look of the Features section

	- Display the Finance Options in an alternative format to improve functionality and readability
	
	- Design your own brand for the page i.e. create a logo and navigation.


Hints
======================================================

While we recognise and appreciate your time is precious, the quality of your sample, both in terms
of how it looks and how it was built "under the hood" will play a major part in our decision to hire
you. We will consider this to be your best possible effort so please take as long as you need.
